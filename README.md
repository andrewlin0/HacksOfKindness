# HacksOfKindness

Ali Ibrahim, Andrew Lin, Alexander Judge, Kaleb Getachew

For this project, we aimed to create a web app that let users connect with people in their community to give or receive help. 
The plan was to have posting boards, Kindcoins, profile pages, and leaderboards. The Kindcoins are designed to incentivize people
to join the app and help out their community. The end goal is to have the kind coins be redeemable for gift cards and promote
kindness throughout the community. The leaderboard is also another incentive for people wanting to be the "kindest" person in their
community.
